        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How does Fire detect wildfires?</h3>
        <p>Fire uses satellite data from NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System). Satellites with VIIRS and MODIS sensors detect thermal anomalies that indicate active fires. Data is typically available within 3 hours of satellite observation.</p>

        <h3>Why don't I see any fires on the map?</h3>
        <p>If no fires are displayed, it may mean there are currently no detected fires in the visible map area. Try zooming out or panning to a different region. You can also pull down to refresh the data.</p>

        <h3>How do I enable fire alerts?</h3>
        <p>Go to Settings tab, enable "Fire Alerts", and grant location permission when prompted. You can configure the alert radius (10-200 km) and minimum fire intensity threshold.</p>

        <h3>Why am I not receiving notifications?</h3>
        <p>Please check:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fire Alerts are enabled in the app's Settings tab</li>
            <li>Notification permission is granted in your device settings</li>
            <li>Location permission is set to "Always" for background monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is my location data shared?</h3>
        <p>No. Your location is only used locally on your device to check for nearby fires. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

        <h3>What do the fire colors mean?</h3>
        <p>Fire markers are color-coded by intensity based on Fire Radiative Power (FRP):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Low intensity</li>
            <li><strong>Orange:</strong> Moderate intensity</li>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> High intensity</li>
            <li><strong>Dark Red:</strong> Extreme intensity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Can I use this app for emergency decisions?</h3>
        <p>No. This app is for informational purposes only. Fire data may be delayed and should not be used as the sole source for emergency decisions. Always follow official emergency services and evacuation orders.</p>
