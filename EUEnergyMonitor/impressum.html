        <h2>EU Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (ODR):
            <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
        <p>
            As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws pursuant to &sect; 7 (1) TMG. According to &sect;&sect; 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of any such infringements, we will remove the relevant content immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
        <p>
            Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
        </p>
