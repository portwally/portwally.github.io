        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 24, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Scanora ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Barcode Data</h3>
        <p>When you scan a product, the barcode number is sent to the Open Food Facts API to retrieve product information. This is necessary to provide the core functionality of the app.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Camera Access</h3>
        <p>Scanora requires camera access to scan barcodes. Camera images are processed locally on your device and are never stored, transmitted, or shared.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>The following data is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan history and favorites</li>
            <li>Shopping list items</li>
            <li>Cached product information</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.</p>

        <h2>3. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>Scanora does not collect, store, or transmit:</p>

            <li>Device identifiers for tracking purposes</li>

            <li>Photos or images from your device</li>
            <li>Account or login information</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Scanora uses the following third-party service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Food Facts API:</strong> We query the Open Food Facts database to retrieve product information. When you scan a barcode, only the barcode number is sent to their servers. Open Food Facts is a non-profit organization. You can review their privacy policy at <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy" target="_blank">openfoodfacts.org/privacy</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>All user data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cached Products:</strong> Product information is cached locally for 7 days for offline access, then automatically refreshed when you rescan.</li>
            <li><strong>Scan History:</strong> Stored indefinitely until you choose to delete it in Settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopping List:</strong> Stored until you remove items or clear the list.</li>
            <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Stored until you unfavorite items.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data can be deleted by uninstalling the app or using the "Clear Data" options in Settings.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take security seriously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All network requests to Open Food Facts use HTTPS encryption</li>
            <li>Local data is protected by iOS's built-in security features</li>
            <li>The app does not require or store any credentials</li>
            <li>No data is synced to cloud services</li>
        </ul>
