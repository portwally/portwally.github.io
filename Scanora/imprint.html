        <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
        <p>As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to general laws pursuant to § 7 para.1 TMG.

        <p>The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
